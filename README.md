# Movie_data_analysis

Movie Data Analysis and Cleaning Project
Overview
This project is centered around cleaning, exploring, and analyzing a movie dataset containing ratings, tags, and movie information. The objective is to clean the data for accurate analysis, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract key insights. The analysis covers various aspects such as time series analysis, visualization, and descriptive statistics.

Project Structure
data/

ratings.csv: Contains user ratings for different movies.
tags.csv: Contains user-generated tags for movies.
movies.csv: Contains movie titles and genres.
notebooks/

movie_cleaning.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook that outlines the steps for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
outputs/

Contains the cleaned data files and generated visualizations (e.g., rating trends).
Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning
Missing Values: Handled missing data through removal and imputation techniques.
Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Timestamp Conversion: Converted Unix timestamps in ratings.csv to a human-readable date format, making time-based analysis easier.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA to understand user behavior, rating patterns, and movie popularity.
Identified patterns like the distribution of ratings and popular movie genres.
3. Visualization
Visualized key trends like the frequency of movie ratings over time.
Generated charts to highlight user activity and movie popularity.
4. Time Series Analysis
Conducted time series analysis by resampling the ratings data to examine trends based on months.
Analyzed how ratings evolved over time, helping to identify periods of high or low activity.
5. Descriptive Statistics
Calculated descriptive statistics to summarize key aspects of the dataset, such as mean ratings, rating counts, and genre distribution.
Key Visualizations
Rating Frequency Over Time: A line chart showing the monthly frequency of movie ratings, highlighting user activity over time.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Libraries:
pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations and handling data arrays.
matplotlib: For creating visualizations and charts.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
